  ```

* **Navigate to the project directory**
  ```bash
  cd giftastic-wishlist-wonder
  ```

* **Install dependencies**

## 🚢 Architecture and Deployment

The GiftHaven platform uses a modern containerized architecture. The entire stack (Frontend, API services, and dependencies) is orchestrated using Docker Compose. The application is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, utilizing Nginx as a reverse proxy to serve the React application and route API requests securely.

### 🌍 Live Access

The application is deployed and publicly accessible via a static AWS Elastic IP address. This ensures a persistent, reliable entry point for users to reach the platform anytime, anywhere. 

* **Live Deployment URL:**
  [http://52.204.222.90](http://52.204.222.90)
  

### 🤖 Automated EC2 Deployment (User Data)

The deployment process is fully automated. When provisioning a new AWS EC2 instance, pass the following bash script into the **User Data** field. 

This script will automatically update the system, install the required base packages, and execute the master deployment script from the GitHub repository, which handles installing Docker, cloning the project, and starting the Docker Compose cluster on boot.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "Updating system..."
apt update -y
apt install -y curl git

echo "Running deployment script from GitHub..."
bash curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nitin962dev/giftastic-wishlist-wonder/main/Automatic-deploy-gift-ai-linux.sh
```

### 🔧 Manual Deployment Steps

If you are accessing an existing server and need to trigger the deployment process manually without the User Data hook, follow these steps:

* **Update system packages**
  ```bash
  apt update -y
  ```

* **Install curl and git**
  ```bash
  apt install -y curl git
  ```

* **Execute the automated deployment script**
  ```bash
  curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nitin962dev/giftastic-wishlist-wonder/main/Automatic-deploy-gift-ai-linux.sh
  ```

* **View running containers**
  ```bash
  docker compose ps
  ```

* **View live application logs**
  ```bash
  docker compose logs -f
  ```
